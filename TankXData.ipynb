    "TankX is a global high-frequency trading firm and a liquidity provider for digital assets, FX, and fixed income markets. Using state-of-art technology infrastructure, advanced mathematical models, and engineering is essential for their business. TankX specializes in data analysis which requires intense study of data obtained from exchanges.\n",

    "n\n",
    " where every character represents a volatility id (every letter of \n",
    "s\n",
    " is an uppercase letter from the latin alphabet). Before conducting the analysis some high-volatility subpatterns are removed to make the analysis healthier. Experts in TankX define a substring to be of high-volatility if it is equal to a pre-determined string \n",

    "1- Remove every single occurence of the string \n",

    ", in \n",
    "s\n",
    " simultaneously. After which, concatenate the resulting fragments caused by the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Repeat the first step, until no high-volatile subtring remains.\n",

    "For example, let the string \n",
